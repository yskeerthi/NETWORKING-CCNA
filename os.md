# ✅ **OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) COMPLETE NOTES**

---

## 🧠 **1. What is an Operating System?**

An **Operating System (OS)** is a **system software** that acts as an **interface between user and hardware**. It manages:

* **Processes**
* **Memory**
* **I/O devices**
* **Files**
* **Security**

---

## 🧰 **2. Functions of an Operating System**

1. **Process Management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
2. **Memory Management**: Allocation/deallocation of RAM
3. **File System Management**: Storing, retrieving files
4. **I/O Management**: Handling input/output devices
5. **Security & Protection**: Access control
6. **User Interface**: CLI or GUI
7. **Error Detection**: Identifies and handles system errors

---

## 🏃‍♂️ **3. Process & Threads**

### ✅ Process:

A program in execution (active entity), has:

* PID (Process ID)
* Program counter
* Registers
* Memory space

### ✅ Threads:

Lightweight processes that share:

* Code
* Data
* Files

✅ **Multithreading**: Multiple threads in a single process

---

## 🔁 **4. Process States**

* **New**
* **Ready**
* **Running**
* **Waiting (Blocked)**
* **Terminated**

✅ **Context Switching**: Switching from one process/thread to another by saving current state and loading the next.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ **5. CPU Scheduling Algorithms**

1. **FCFS** (First Come First Serve)
2. **SJF** (Shortest Job First)
3. **Round Robin** (with time quantum)
4. **Priority Scheduling**
5. **Multilevel Queue**

✅ **Preemptive** vs **Non-Preemptive** scheduling

---

## 🧠 **6. Deadlocks**

### ✅ Deadlock Conditions:

1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

### ✅ Solutions:

* **Prevention**: Break at least one condition
* **Avoidance**: Banker's Algorithm
* **Detection & Recovery**: Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)

---

## 💾 **7. Memory Management**

### ✅ Concepts:

* **Logical Address** (generated by CPU)
* **Physical Address** (location in RAM)
* **MMU**: Translates logical → physical

---

## 🧱 **8. Paging & Segmentation**

### ✅ Paging:

* Fixed-size blocks: **Pages** (logical) & **Frames** (physical)
* Solves **external fragmentation**

### ✅ Segmentation:

* Variable-size segments (code, data, stack)
* Based on logical division

---

## 🧠 **9. Page Replacement Algorithms**

1. **FIFO**
2. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
3. **Optimal**
4. **Clock Algorithm**

---

## ⚠️ **10. Thrashing**

When OS spends more time on **paging** than on execution → performance drops.

✅ Solution: Increase memory or reduce degree of multiprogramming.

---

## 🔐 **11. Virtual Memory**

Use of **disk space** as an **extension of RAM**.
Implemented using:

* **Paging**
* **Demand Paging**
* **Swapping**

---

## 📁 **12. File Management**

OS handles:

* File creation, deletion
* Directories
* Access control

File Allocation Methods:

* **Contiguous**
* **Linked**
* **Indexed**

---

## 📦 **13. Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

1. **FCFS**
2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
3. **SCAN**
4. **C-SCAN**
5. **LOOK**

---

## 🔗 **14. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

Used for communication between processes.

Techniques:

* **Pipes**
* **Message Queues**
* **Shared Memory**
* **Sockets**
* **Semaphores**

---

## 🚦 **15. Synchronization & Concurrency**

### ✅ Critical Section:

Code segment that accesses shared data

### ✅ Solutions:

* **Peterson's Algorithm**
* **Semaphores**
* **Monitors**
* **Mutex**

---

## 📊 **16. Semaphores**

A synchronization tool:

```c
wait(S);
signal(S);
```

### ✅ Binary Semaphore: 0 or 1

### ✅ Counting Semaphore: Integer value

---

## 🧟 **17. Process Types**

* **Zombie**: Completed but still in process table
* **Orphan**: Child whose parent died before it

---

## 🔐 **18. Protection & Security**

* User authentication
* Access control
* Encryption

---

## 🔥 **19. System Architecture**

* **Monolithic Kernel**: All services in one block (Linux)
* **Microkernel**: Minimal kernel, rest in user-space (Minix)

---

## ⚡ **20. Advanced Concepts**

### ✅ Booting:

Loading OS into RAM during startup.

### ✅ System Calls:

Interface to interact with OS kernel.
